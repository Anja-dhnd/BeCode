# The Hangman Game

This is a JavaScript challenge realized during my training at BeCode. It is a reproduction of the famous hangman word game. 
[Click here](https://anja-dhnd.github.io/Hangman/) to see the final result. 

## Minimum functionalities 

The following features had to be included:

- propose a hidden word (done)
- allow the selection of letters (done)
- verify if a selected letter belongs to the word (done)
- count the number of attempts (done)
- check if it's a game over (done)
- check if the word has been found (done)

Besides that, we could choose to include some extra elements (which I haven't done, but plan on doing when I catch up on my projects):


- keep in memory all guessed letters
- only let the player guess a letter once
- add an image for each step
- check keyboard recognition
- use canvas

## How I proceeded

I first thought about the general structure of my hangman and how the backend and frontend had to be correlated. I started by writing the HTML code keeping in mind all the elements I had to integrate for the JS part, to which I switched after I was done with HTML. It's only at the very end that I styled my page with CSS (through SASS).
