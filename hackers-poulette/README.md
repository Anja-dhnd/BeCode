[![forthebadge](https://forthebadge.com/images/badges/powered-by-coffee.svg)](https://forthebadge.com)

This challenge has been done during my training at BeCode in order to practice PHP. We had 3 days to finish it. My main objective was to give in something functional, even if I was unable to meet all the other criterias.



## Missions objectives

As per instructions, "the company Hackers Poulette â„¢ sells Raspberry Pi accessory kits to build your own. They want to allow their users to contact their support team. Your mission is to create a fully-functioning online "contact support" form, in PHP. It must display a contact form and process the received answer (sanitize, validate, answer the user)."

The form had to be comprised of the first and last name, gender, country, email, topic of the message and finally the message.

Must have:

  - [x]  the project repository must include a low-fidelity mock-up
  - [x] the form's html code must be semantically valid
  - [ ] the HTML must be accessible to blind people
  - [ ] in case of wrong input, the form should display a useful visual clue about the error
  - [ ] display the error message near the correct input field
  - [ ] the error message must be readable (helpful to users)
  - [x]  the form has to be sanitised and validated (server side)
  - [x]  if all required inputs are valid, the script should respond by email to a given address
  - [x] implement a honeypot anti spam technique.

Optional:

  - [ ] client side validation with JavaScript
  - [x]  work on a good and clear user experience (UX)
  - [ ] respond to the user request with Ajax
